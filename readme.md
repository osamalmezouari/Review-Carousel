## Description

This project, developed using TypeScript and Sass, is a review carousel application that enables users to navigate through a collection of reviews. It offers functionalities to move to the next and previous reviews using navigation buttons, automatic page changes with time passing, and a button to display a random review from the collection.

- **End-to-Start/Start-to-End Navigation:** When reaching the end of the reviews and clicking the right button, the carousel returns to the first review. Similarly, when at the first review and clicking the left button, it navigates to the last review.
